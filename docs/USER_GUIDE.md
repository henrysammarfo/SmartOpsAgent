# SmartOpsAgent - Complete User Guide

## What is SmartOpsAgent?

SmartOpsAgent is an AI-powered DevOps monitoring dashboard that gives you real-time visibility into your infrastructure, deployments, and blockchain networks. Instead of switching between multiple tools (Vercel, GitHub, Alchemy), you get everything in one intelligent dashboard.

## Best Practices

### Daily Monitoring Routine
1. **Morning**: Check Overview dashboard for overnight incidents
2. **Before Deployments**: Check Web3 gas prices and system resources
3. **After Deployments**: Monitor pipeline status and verify success
4. **Evening**: Review incident history and resolve any open issues

### Alert Configuration
- Set CPU threshold at 80% for warnings, 90% for critical
- Set memory threshold at 85% for warnings, 95% for critical
- Set gas price alerts based on your budget (e.g., alert when > 50 gwei)
- Enable Discord/Slack notifications for critical alerts only

### Performance Optimization
- Use time range filters to reduce data load
- Close unused browser tabs
- Enable dark mode to reduce eye strain
- Set refresh interval to 30 seconds instead of real-time for less critical metrics
